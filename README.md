# Blush Midtown
  
  ## Description
  This a local salon that was had a Wix page and used Meevo for transactions. The integration between Meevo and Wix was poor looking and convoluted. Their current setup took them entirely out of the flow of their webpage taking them to a different url for booking that didn't match their aesthetic of their website. I replicated their current website from the ground up as a React JS application. This allowed for us to just hit the Meevo apis and keep the customer in the flow of the webpage. I've built a backend for them which was needed for authentication since Meevo doesn't handle that with their APIs. Since we built a backend for that, I simple expanded it in case the client decided to move off of meevo booking and payment processing. This will become more convoluted as they have a page they use to update current booked appointments. Some sort of system would need to be setup for them to do that. They are deployed to Github which is picked up by Netlify. The domain registrar is still handled by Wix.

  ## Installation
  They would need to download the file and type npm install and then type npm run build and then npm run start:dev. This would allow them to access the localhost or they could access the test website at https://blushmidtown-develop.netlify.app/. The full production website can be located at blushmidtownsalon.com
  ## Usage
  You can see an overview on the landing page. You can also check out the service menu to see what services are available. Clicking the Meet the Staff button will allow you to view stylists and find out information about them. The photo gallery shows work the salon has done. The "Work with Us" tab is for people curious about working at Blush. The Salon Policies is self explanatory and the Book Online tab is what the point of this whole project was. My github is linked in the footer of the page for people to wrap back to.
